            <h2>
                Avatar: The Last Airbender (Avatar: The Legend of Aang in some regions) is an American animated television series
                 created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, with Aaron Ehasz as head writer. It aired on Nickelodeon 
                 for three seasons, from February 2005 to July 2008. Avatar is set in an Asiatic-like world in which some people 
                 can manipulate the classical elements with psychokinetic variants of the Chinese martial arts known as "bending"; 
                 one individual, the Avatar, is capable of bending all four elements and is responsible for maintaining harmony between 
                 the world's four nations. It is presented in a style that combines anime with American cartoons and relies on the 
                 imagery of East/South Asian, Inuit, and New World societies.

            <h2>
                The series is centered around the journey of 12-year-old Aang, the Avatar and last survivor of his nation, the Air Nomads, 
                 along with his friends Sokka, Katara, and later on Toph, as they strive to end the Fire Nation's war against the other nations 
                 of the world. It also follows the story of Zuko—the exiled prince of the Fire Nation seeking to restore his lost honor 
                 by capturing Aang, accompanied by his wise uncle Iroh—and later that of his ambitious sister Azula.
